% GETIGRFCOEFS Extract IGRF coefficients from .dat files.
% 
% Usage: GETIGRFCOEFS(DATADIRECTORY)
%     or COEFS = GETIGRFCOEFS(DATADIRECTORY)
% 
% Use this function to extract the IGRF coefficients from .dat files
% provided on this IGRF website here:
% 
% https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/modelweb/geomagnetic/igrf/fortran_code/
% 
% The .dat files should be located in the directory DATADIRECTORY. If
% DATADIRECTORY is unspecified, this function will look for a directory
% called "datfiles" within the directory that this file is in or, if that
% does not exist, will just use the directory that this file is in. The
% coefficients are stored as a structure array with the following fields
% (case-sensitive):
% 
%    -year: Year for the coefficients of that index in the array.
%    -gh: g and h coefficients in a vector.
%    -g: g coefficients in a matrix with each n going down the rows and
%    all of the m's for each n going along the columns.
%    -h: h coefficients in a matrix with each n going down the rows and
%    all of the m's for each n going along the columns.
%    -slope: True if the coefficients are slopes, false otherwise.
% 
% The elements in the structure array will be sorted by year (i.e., the
% first structure in the array will have the earliest year and the last
% structure in the array will have the latest year). This structure array
% is returned to the user as the output from this function if requested. If
% no outputs are requested, the variable COEFS is saved to the file
% igrfcoefs.mat in the same directory as this file as 'coefs' (i.e., in
% lower case).
% 
% Inputs:
%   -DATADIRECTORY: directory where the .dat IGRF coefficients can be
%   found (optional, default is the directory datfiles within the same
%   directory that this function is located or, if that does not exist, the
%   directory where this function is located.
% 
% Outputs:
%   -COEFS: Structure array with fields as explained above.
